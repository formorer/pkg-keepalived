Description: Failover and monitoring daemon for LVS clusters
 keepalived is used for monitoring real servers within a Linux
 Virtual Server (LVS) cluster.  keepalived can be configured to
 remove real servers from the cluster pool if it stops responding,
 as well as send a notification email to make the admin aware of
 the service failure.
 .
 In addition, keepalived implements an independent Virtual Router
 Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2; see rfc2338 for additional info)
 framework for director failover.
 .
 You need a kernel >= 2.4.28 or >= 2.6.11 for keepalived.
 See README.Debian for more information.
