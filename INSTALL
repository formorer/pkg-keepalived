Kernel needs
==============

  Compile a kernel with the following options :

  Kernel/User netlink socket
  LinuxVirtualServer

  Keepalived supports all LVS code, including IPVS code for kernel 2.4.

Library dependencies
====================

  In order to compile Keepalived needs the following libraries :

  * OpenSSL, <www.openssl.org>

Installation
============

  1. uncompress the tarball
  2. cd into the directory
  3. './configure'
  4. 'make'
  5. 'make install'. This will install keepalived on your system,
     binaries and configuration file :
     * keepalived : The keepalived daemon program.
     * genhash : The MD5 url digest generator. You need it to 
                 configure HTTP GET check and SSL GET check in
                 order to compute MD5SUM digest etalon.
     * /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
  6. link keepalived.init into your runlevel directory. On Red Hat systems :
     ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/keepalived.init /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99keepalived

  By default the configure script uses /usr/local as base directory. You can
  change this value to your own by passing it the --prefix value.

  eg: './configure --prefix=/usr/'

Configuration
=============

  Just take a look at the /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf file installed.
  It will give you all the information needed. If you want more information
  about keepalived, please refer to the keepalived homepage into the
  documentation section.
